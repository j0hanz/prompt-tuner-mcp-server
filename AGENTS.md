# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure

- `src/` holds the TypeScript source for the MCP server, with `index.ts` as the entry point and `server.ts` for server setup.
- `src/tools/`, `src/resources/`, `src/prompts/`, and `src/schemas/` contain tool implementations, resource handlers, prompt definitions, and Zod schemas.
- `src/lib/` and `src/config/` contain shared utilities and configuration types.
- `tests/` contains Vitest tests named `*.test.ts`.
- `dist/` is build output (generated by `npm run build`).
- `docs/` contains documentation assets (for example, `docs/logo.png`).
- `CONFIGURATION.md` documents environment variables and advanced settings.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

- `npm run build`: Compile TypeScript and set executable permissions on `dist/index.js`.
- `npm run dev` / `npm run dev:http`: Run the server in watch mode (stdio or HTTP).
- `npm run start` / `npm run start:http`: Run the built server from `dist/`.
- `npm run test` / `npm run test:watch`: Run Vitest once or in watch mode.
- `npm run lint`: Run ESLint.
- `npm run format`: Run Prettier.
- `npm run type-check`: Type-check without emitting.
- `npm run inspector`: Launch the MCP Inspector against the built server.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

- Prettier enforces 2-space indentation, single quotes, semicolons, 80-column width, and LF line endings.
- ESLint (TypeScript strict) enforces explicit return types, type-only imports, and no `any`.
- Naming: `camelCase` for variables/functions, `PascalCase` for types/classes, `UPPER_CASE` for constants; leading underscores are allowed when needed.
- Keep imports sorted using the configured Prettier import order.

## Testing Guidelines

- Vitest runs in Node and includes `tests/**/*.test.ts`.
- Name new tests with the `.test.ts` suffix and place them in `tests/`.
- Add or update tests for new tools, prompt behaviors, or schema changes.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

- Recent commits are sentence-case and verb-leading, with occasional version-only release commits (for example, `1.0.4`).
- Keep commits focused and descriptive; follow the observed style.
- PRs should include a concise summary, rationale, tests run, and any config/doc updates; link related issues when applicable.
- Screenshots are only needed when documentation assets or output examples change.

## Security & Configuration Notes

- Never commit API keys; configure providers via environment variables as documented in `CONFIGURATION.md`.
- Preserve Zod validation and error-handling patterns when adding new inputs or tools.
- Treat `dist/` as generated output; rebuild instead of editing compiled files directly.
